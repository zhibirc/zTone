JavaScript Code Principles and Style Guide

There are many perfect guides and tutorials how to write clear and understandable code. Also our world has such outstanding tools to control clearness of JavaScript code as JSLint.
So I think that it's not necessary and even a bad idea to compose something in this sphere. Instead of reinventing the wheel I want to formulate some common principles and approaches for 
writing clear, well readable, self-explained, efficient JavaScript code. The ideas expressed here can use for creating own detailed style guides inside developer teams.

- use well known acronyms to make naming of auxiliary identifiers in your code (e.g. default parameters in loop methods) more consistent and self-explained
str => string
pts => points
ret => return
idx => index
