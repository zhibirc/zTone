Once upon a time I've created some partial cookbook for writing high-quality JavaScript code. It was about naming of identifiers of some kind and usage some language syntax.

Currently I look at this attempt as of good experience, but essentially that tutorial is obsolete due to changes in my mind.

I've saved it for historical reasons: [how it was](history.md) :baby_chick:

It's not absolutely wrong in all its propositions or statements, but in most it does... so, here the new generation and new vision on subject.
